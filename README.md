# Beautiful Hugo - An adaptation of the Beautiful Jekyll theme

...but torn apart by me, the forker.

## Installation

```sh
mkdir themes
cd themes
git submodule add https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo.git beautifulhugo
```

See [the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/themes/installing/) for more information.

## Extra Features

### Responsive

This theme is designed to look great on both large-screen and small-screen (mobile) devices.

### Syntax highlighting

This theme has support for either Hugo's lightning fast Chroma, or both server side and client side highlighting. See [the Hugo docs for more](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/).

#### Chroma - New server side syntax highlighting

To enable Chroma, add the following to your site parameters:

```toml
pygmentsCodeFences = true
pygmentsUseClasses = true
```

Then, you can generate a different style by running:

```sh
hugo gen chromastyles --style=trac > static/css/syntax.css
```

### Multilingual

To allow Beautiful Hugo to go multilingual, you need to define the languages
you want to use inside the `languages` parameter on `config.toml` file, also
redefining the content dir for each one. Check the `i18n/` folder to see all
languages available.

```toml
[languages]
  [languages.en] 
    contentDir = "content/en" # English
  [languages.ja]
    contentDir = "content/ja" # Japanese
  [languages.br]
    contentDir = "content/br" # Brazilian Portuguese
```

Now you just need to create a subdir within the `content/` folder for each
language and just put stuff inside `page/` and `post/` regular directories.

```text
content/      content/      content/  
└── en/       └── br/       └── ja/ 
    ├── page/     ├── page/     ├── page/
    └── post/     └── post/     └── post/

```

### Extra shortcodes

There are two extra shortcodes provided (along with the customized figure shortcode):

#### Details

This simply adds the html5 detail attribute, supported on all *modern* browsers. Use it like this:

```hugo
{{< details "This is the details title (click to expand)" >}}
This is the content (hidden until clicked).
{{< /details >}}
```

#### Split

This adds a two column side-by-side environment (will turn into 1 col for narrow devices):

```hugo
{{< columns >}}
This is column 1.
{{< column >}}
This is column 2.
{{< endcolumns >}}
```
